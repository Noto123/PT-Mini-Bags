# ProfitTrailer - Mini bags

This strategy is an adaptation of the PT Diluting Strategy. It tries to help you get rid of bags that are stuck. The main difference is that my strategy calculates the size of the bag to be close to dust value. This reduces the amount of budget you need and lowers the chance to get stuck with another bag.

Feel free to change the values for buying DCA and taking profit as you see fit.

Keep in mind, I am not a financial advisor and I cannot be held responsible for any losses you may take while using this strategy.
